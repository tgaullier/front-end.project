The new website AG Tracker is on development!

This Web Site provides a new way to track your anime and their specific video games.
In our website you will be able to add your favorite animes to your list and track their completition if you have the game related to.
For example: +Add Naruto Shippuden (ANIME) +Add Naruto Storm 4 (GAME).
In your Anime list you will then have a big table containing the Anime name, some infos/stats, the Anime games, their completition (trophy, % and so on).
You can add, off course, a lot of animes to your list.
You will have your own account on our website, so you can connect and save your datas whenever you want :)
